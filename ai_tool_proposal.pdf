Submitted By: Joseph Alex
Course: AI in Software Engineering – Week 4 Assignment

🧠 Tool Overview
AI DocuMate is a proposed AI-powered solution designed to automate the generation and maintenance of source code documentation. It addresses the common software engineering challenge of outdated, missing, or inconsistent documentation—especially in fast-paced or legacy codebases.

🎯 Purpose
Automatically generate high-quality docstrings, function summaries, and API references.

Enhance team collaboration, developer onboarding, and long-term maintainability.

Integrate seamlessly into existing CI/CD workflows and IDEs.

🔄 Workflow
Code Parsing: Analyzes source code using abstract syntax trees (AST).

AI-Powered Understanding: Uses large language models to extract intent, arguments, return types, and logic.

Doc Generation: Adds:

Inline docstrings for classes/functions.

Markdown/API reference files.

Change Tracking: Detects diffs and regenerates docs only for updated sections.

IDE & Git Integration: Works as a plugin or pre-commit hook in VS Code, PhpStorm, etc.

🌍 Impact
Saves time by reducing manual documentation tasks.

Improves code readability and team productivity.

Encourages documentation as part of DevOps culture.

Bridges technical gaps between devs, PMs, and stakeholders.

✅ Why It Matters
Good documentation is critical but often neglected. AI DocuMate helps solve this by making documentation smart, automatic, and continuous, promoting better software quality and team collaboration.
