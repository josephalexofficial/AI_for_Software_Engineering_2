ðŸ“Š 200-Word Analysis:

Both implementations correctly sort a list of dictionaries by the "age" key, but their behavior differs slightly. The manual version uses Pythonâ€™s built-in sorted() function, which returns a new list, leaving the original data unchanged. This is safer and more functional, especially in larger applications where immutability reduces bugs.

The AI-suggested Copilot version modifies the original list in place using list.sort(). This is more memory-efficient for large datasets but can lead to side effects if the original list is reused elsewhere.

In terms of performance, both methods are equally fast (O(n log n)), but the manual version is more explicit and safer. Copilotâ€™s code is concise and works well for simple cases, but developers should be cautious of its in-place behavior.

Conclusion:
Copilotâ€™s suggestion is efficient and valid, but the manual version is more robust and maintainable in professional codebases. Developers should always review AI-generated code for side effects and consistency with their projectâ€™s design principles.
