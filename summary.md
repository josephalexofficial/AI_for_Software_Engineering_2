ðŸ“‹ 150-Word Summary:

Using Testim.io, I created an automated test for a sample login form covering both valid and invalid credential scenarios. The AI-powered test builder allowed me to record user actions and automatically recognize UI elements, even when attributes like ID or class changed between runs.

AI-enhanced element detection improves test resilience and maintainability compared to traditional Selenium scripts, which often break after minor UI changes. It also enabled parameterized testing, letting me validate multiple input sets with minimal manual duplication.

Compared to manual testing, the AI-driven approach improved test coverage, ensured faster execution across browsers, and reduced human error. AI suggestions also helped detect missing validation scenarios I had not considered initially.

Conclusion:
AI-powered tools like Testim reduce the time spent writing fragile scripts and make test automation smarter and more adaptable, especially for modern dynamic frontends.
